Codes do the following:

1. From LIDC-IDRI dataset: a) extract 40x40 lung nodule patches (16 slices per nodule), b) extract mean malignancy rating and create folders according to this
2. Create a 3D CNN
3. Apply self training algorithm to classify the stringly labelled nodules with the aid of the weakly-labelled dataset

Codes work but need some cleaning.
